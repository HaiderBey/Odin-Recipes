        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka (or shakshouka) is a traditional Tunisian dish featuring poached eggs in a spicy tomato sauce with onions, bell pepper, and garlic. It's usually eaten for breakfast, but I think it makes a tasty lunch or dinner, served with lots of bread to mop up the sauce.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
